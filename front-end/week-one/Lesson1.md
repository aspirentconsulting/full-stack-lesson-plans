### Back to the Front-End

### Reminders

- Most talks will be using React, but all templates are available in the repo for you to follow along with in Vue or Angular

- Feel free to to speak up at any time. This is not just me talking. And I will call on people.

- Some topics I will talk about in this series may have been covered in the React talks. If so I will go over them in more depth and detail this time.

### Structure

- Front-end will follow the back-end lessons and use them for continuity

- First lessons will be code light and config heavy (more in a bit)

- Every week we will cover a new pattern, library, testing concept, config, and CI/CD options.

- Goal is to keep a working app at all times that you can others can reference when needed

### The Most Important Idea to Remember

> Code = Tooling, Testing, and DevOps

The code your produce is a direct result of those three inputs. Focus on those, and your application will thrive.
